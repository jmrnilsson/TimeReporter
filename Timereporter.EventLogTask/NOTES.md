# NOTES: Event log task

This assembly was created created to avoid having to change the DEBUG setting from IIS Express to Project and DEBUG
argument to toggle command-line mode and web server mode. To avoid this a separate NetCode Console.App was created and 
consequently the DEBUG-settings are segregated by projects.
